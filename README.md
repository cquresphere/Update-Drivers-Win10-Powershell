Powershell Script to Update Drivers in Windows 10

Base for this project was script from StackOverflow with Update. The problem was it works only on Windows 7. 
I thought it would be easy to adjust but it turns out it requires a lot of testing. 

This script starts with checking if terminal is runing with administrator priviledge.
If it is not it propmts notification about requirement. 

Then it installs required PowerShell modules.
